# HTML & SVG Components

## `.new`

It’s worth noting that `Phlex::SGML` overrides `.new` in order to capture the block during instantiation. This block will not be passed on to your `#initialize` method. Instead, it is passed to your `#view_template` method when the component is rendered.

## `.register_element`

Allows you to define a custom element that can be used in your templates. Since this defines an instance method, it’s inherited by subclasses.

```ruby{2,5}
class MyComponent < Phlex::HTML
  register_element :trix_editor

  def view_template
    trix_editor
  end
end
```

## `#after_template`

A hook that is called after the template is rendered. Can be overridden to add custom behavior.

## `#around_template`

A hook that wraps the template rendering. Can be overridden to add custom behavior before and after rendering. You should always call `super` in your implementation.

```ruby
def around_template
  puts "Before rendering"
  super
  puts "After rendering"
end
```

## `#await`

Waits for an asynchronous task to complete. If the task isn’t completed, it flushes. Supports `Concurrent::IVar` and `Async::Task`.

## `#before_template`

A hook that is called before the template is rendered. Can be overridden to add custom behavior.

## `#call`

Renders the view and returns the buffer. The default buffer is a mutable String.

## `#capture`

Captures the block and returns the output as a string. In Rails, this is an `ActionView::SafeBuffer`.

## `#comment`

Outputs an HTML comment. You can wrap other content and the content will still be rendered.

## `#context`

Returns the current render context data.

## `#flush`

Flushes the buffer if not capturing.

## `#format_object`

Formats an object for output. Can be overridden to handle different object types.

## `#plain`

Outputs text content. The text will be HTML-escaped.

## `#render?`

Determines if the component should render. By default, it returns `true`. Override this method to conditionally render the component.

## `#render`

Renders another component, block, string, or enumerable of the above.

## `#vanish`

Similar to `#capture`, but the output is discarded.

## `#whitespace`

Outputs a whitespace character. Useful for getting inline elements to wrap. You can optionall pass a block to wrap the content with a whitespace character on before and after.

## `#view_template`

The main template method that should be overridden in subclasses to define the component’s structure.
