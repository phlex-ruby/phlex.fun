# Fragments

The `fragment` helper allows you to define named template fragments which can be targeted while rendering.

```rb
class MyComponent < Phlex::HTML
  def view_template
    section do
      fragment("my-list") do  # Explicitly declare renderable fragment [!code ++]
        ul do
          li { "Item 1" }
          li { "Item 2" }
        end
      end # [!code ++]
    end
  end
end
```

Now you can render specific fragments by passing in a list of target fragments to the `call` method.

```ruby
MyComponent.new.call(fragments: ["my-list"])
```

When fragments are cached, Phlex also stores the byte ranges of each fragment. Then it can slice just the fragments youâ€™re looking for from the cache.

You should be able to use `cache` and `fragment` together without any problems.
